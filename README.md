# pyflask_aws_practice
The following project uses Python flask to create a basic website, and Boto 2 to connect to AWS.
the aim of this, is to create a simple mock music artist subscription site, in which a user can:
- sign up
- login
- search for artist
- subscribe to artists
- unsubscribe from artists

## known issues
- incredibly insecure as the aim was to successfully connect to aws and learn flask
- ui and subscription process is not user friendly
- needs working aws to function
